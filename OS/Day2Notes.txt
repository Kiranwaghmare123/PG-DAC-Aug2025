Process:
-The process is basically an instance of the computer proram that is being executes.
-short lifespan
-H/w : CPU, i/o devices, memory
-runtime instance
-dynamic instance

Program:
-A program is vbasically a collection of instructions that mainly performs a specific task when execution starts.
-long lifespan
-memory: hardisk
-executable code
-static code

Process control Block:
------------------------
-Process state
-Program counter
-CPu registers
-CPu algorithms
-CPU scheduleing information
-Memory management information
-Accounting information
-I/O status information


Process life cycle: States
--------------------
1. New
2. Running
3. Waiting
4. Ready
5. Terminated

Process scheduling:
-------------------
-It is the act of determining which process is in the ready state, and should be moved to the running state is known as Process scheduling.


Types of process:
-------------------
1. Non-preemptive
2. Preemptive





Scheduling algorithms:
----------------------
1. Non-preemptive scheduling
2. Preemptive scheding


Job Queue: Process to be in execution
Ready queue: Process waiting for execution
I/O Queue:

Operations on Process:
----------------------
1. Process creation
-fork or spawn
2. Process Termination


Redirection operators:
-----------------------

> : Redirect output to a file
Ex: ls > abc.txt

>> :Append output of a file.
EX: 

< : REdirect input from a file


|: Pipe

Meta characters:
 ? * [] -(Range)
 Ex: [abcd]*
 Ex: [a-d]*
 
 
 Vi Editor:
 ---------
 i : insert model
 Esc + :wq => save +quit
