Day 1 : Introduction to OS
COS Session Zoom
------------------------------
Topics: 
	-Introduction to OS
	-Concept of OS
	-Application Software
	-Hardware dependent
	-Components of OS
	-Types of OS		
	-Functions of OS 
	-User and Kernel space & model
	-Interrupts & system calls
	-Introduction to Linux


Operation System:
--------------------
-Os is a program that manges the computer hardware
-It also provide a basis for Application programs and acts as a intermediary between user and computer hardware.

Multiprocessor System:
---------------------

1. Client-server architecute

2. Peer to Peer architecture

3. Symmetric Multiprogramming

4. Asymmeteric Multiprogramming

Interrupt:
---------
-It is an event usually defines as  it alters the sequence of instructions executed by a processor.

Without Interrupt:
1. Instruction Fetch
2. Intruction Execution

With Interrupt:
1. Instruction Fetch
2. Intruction Execution
3. Check Interrupt

Intrrupt Handling Technique:

1. Polling
2. Vectored interrupted system


Introduction to Linux:
------------------------
Linux:
	-Open source
	-Free
	-Free software
	-Live CD Distribution
	-Secure
	-No
	-Low hardware cost
	-Customizable add features


Windows:
	-Closed source
	-Cost
	-Cost software
	-No
	-Insecure
	-Virus, Malware : Antivirus
	-High Hardware cost
	-Not customizable


UNIX:
------
 -Operating System
 -1969, AT&T Bell Lab by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritche
 -Command Line Interpreter
 -In was developed for the mini-computers and time sharing systems.
 -UNIX was the predecessor of LINUX
 
Features:
	-Security
	-Multi-user
	-Inter process comunication
	-Extensive network support
	-Data sent to display , files, or printer...


LINUX:
-Invented by Linus Torvalds in 1991.
-Open source
-LINUX ia a variant of UNIX
-Multi-user, Multitasking and multiprocessor programming


Distributions :

UBuntu
Linux mint
Debian
Fedora
CentOS

Layers of Linux/Unix:
----------------------

Kernel:
-It is the core component of UNIX OS
-It is responsible to execute commands
-It is responsible to interact with hardware components
-It is also responsible for memory loocation and process allocation 

Shell:
------
-It is athe outer layer of UNIX operating system
- The shell is a program that sits on the interface between user and kernel
-It is a command interpreter and also has programming capability of it's own.
-Shell types:
	-Bourne shell(sh) :First shell by Stephen Bourne
	-C shell(sh)
	-Korn shell(ksh)
	-Bourne Again Shell(bash)

Bourne Again Shell(bash):
--------------------------
-command language interpreter
-It is a replacement of Bourne shell(sh)

File system:
------------
-Linux treats everything as a file including hardware devices.
-Arranged as a directory in hierchical order
-Top level directory : Root directory (/)

-Types of files:
-----------------
	1. Normal file: These files contain data.
	-It can be either text file (abc.txt) or binary file(img, video)
	
	2.Directory files:These files represents directory
	-Directory can contain files and subdirectories
	
	3.Device files:In Linux, every device is represented as a file.
	By using these files we can communicate with that device.
	
	
	The first character represents the type of file:
	d : Directory file
	- : Normal file
	| : Link file
	c : Character Special file
	b : Block special file
	s : Socket file
	
	Common Commands:
	----------------
	pwd: print working directory
	ls:  List our all files and directories
	mkdir: Create directory
	cd : Change directory
	touch : To create a file
	rmdir : Remove directory
	rm : To remove file
	cal : Display Monthly calander
	date: Display the current date and time
	help: To display list of commands
	hello : To display brief system information
	clear: To clear terminal
	exit : To logout
